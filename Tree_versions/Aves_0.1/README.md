    - full tree  
    - phylo only tree  
    - dated tree  
    - many nitty gritty internal synthesis outputs. These are detailed in depth in the index.html file contained in the OpenTree synth folder
* A folder for Clements2021
    - phylo_only_dated.tre  <- Ultrametric Clements labeled tree including only tips with phylogenetic information
    - tree_cloud <- set of 100 complete trees from 100 stochastic taxon addition replicates
    - MCC.tre <- Maximim clade credibility tree including all taxa in this version of the taxonomy summarized from the dated trees using random selections for the node calibrations. Labelled with Clements taxonomy labels.
