Although a single trait appears sufficient to convey information, many sexually dimorphic species exhibit multiple sexual signals, which may be costly to signalers and receivers. Given that one signal may be enough, there are many microevolutionary hypotheses to explain the evolution of multiple signals. Here we extend these hypotheses to a macroevolutionary scale and compare those predictions to the patterns of gains and losses of sexual dimorphism in pheasants and partridges. Among nine dimorphic characters, including six intersexual signals and three indicators of competitive ability, all exhibited both gains and losses of dimorphism within the group. Although theories of intersexual selection emphasize gain and elaboration, those six characters exhibited greater rates of loss than gain; in contrast, the competitive traits showed a slight bias towards gains. The available models, when examined in a macroevolutionary framework, did not yield unique predictions, making it difficult to distinguish among them. Even with this limitation, when the predictions of these alternative models were compared with the heterogeneous patterns of evolution of dimorphism in phasianids, it is clear that many different selective processes have been involved in the evolution of sexual signals in this group.},

	abstract = {Abstract 
            Migration plays a fundamental part in the life of most temperate bird species. The regular, large-scale seasonal movements that characterize temperate migration systems appear to have originated in parallel with the postglacial northern expansion of tropical species. Migratoriness is also influenced by a number of ecological factors, such as the ability to survive harsh winters. Hence, understanding the origins and evolution of migration requires integration of the biogeographic history and ecology of birds in a phylogenetic context. We used molecular dating and ancestral state reconstruction to infer the origins and evolutionary changes in migratory behavior and ancestral area reconstruction to investigate historical patterns of range evolution in accipitrid birds of prey (Accipitriformes). Migration evolved multiple times in birds of prey, the earliest of which occurred in true hawks (Accipitrinae), during the middle Miocene period, according to our analyses. In most cases, a tropical ancestral distribution was inferred for the non-migratory ancestors of migratory lineages. Results from directional evolutionary tests indicate that migration evolved in the tropics and then increased the rate of colonization of temperate habitats, suggesting that temperate species might be descendants of tropical ones that dispersed into these seasonal habitats. Finally, we found that diet generalization predicts migratoriness in this group.

            Összefoglalás 
            A legtöbb mérsékelt övi madárfaj életciklusában alapvető szerepet tölt be a vonulás. A rendszeres, nagy kiterjedésű mozgások, melyek a mérsékelt övi vonulási rendszereket jellemzik, egyes feltételezések szerint a trópusi fajok poszt-glaciális, északi irányú terjeszkedésével párhuzamosan jelentek meg. Ezen felül a vonulás előfordulását számos ökológiai tényező is befolyásolhatja, mint például a környezet szezonalitásának mértéke vagy a téli túlélést befolyásoló tényezők. A vonulás eredete és evolúciója ezért csak úgy érthető meg, ha a madarak biogeográfiai történetiségét és ökológiáját filogenetikai kontextusban tanulmányozzuk. Jelen vizsgálatban a vágómadár-alakúak (Accipitriformes) vonulásának evolúcióját elemeztük komparatív módszerekkel. Első lépésben létrehoztunk egy fosszilis adatok alapján datált molekuláris törzsfát, amelyen jellegrekonstrukciót végeztünk és rekonstruáltuk a fajok ősi elterjedési területét. Az elemzéseink alapján a vonulás többször alakult ki a ragadozók esetében, legkorábban a héjaformákon (Accipitrinae) belül, vélhetően a Miocén közepén. A legtöbb esetben a vonuló leszármazási vonalak nem vonuló őseinél trópusi elterjedésre következtethetünk. A direkcionális evolúciós teszt alapján a vonulás a trópusokon jelent meg és megnövelte a mérsékelt égöv kolonizációjának rátáját. Eszerint tehát a mérsékelt övi ragadozómadár fajok vonuló trópusi fajok leszármazottainak tekinthetők, melyek az erősen szezonális, északi élőhelyek irányába terjeszkedtek. Végezetül negatív kapcsolatot találtunk a vonulás megjelenése és a táplálékspecializáció mértéke között.},

The flightless species are believed to have diverged from a flying common ancestor during the Late Pleistocene; however, their taxonomy remains contentious. Of particular interest is the previously unstudied population of flying steamer ducks in the Falkland Islands. We present the first genetic data from this insular population, and illustrate that the flying and flightless steamer ducks on the Falkland Islands are genetically indistinguishable, in contrast to their traditional classification as separate species. The three species that reside in continental South America form a genetically distinct lineage from the Falkland Island ducks. The Falkland steamer ducks diverged from their continental relatives 2.2–0.6 million years ago, coincident with a probable land bridge connecting the Falkland Islands to the mainland. The three continental species share a common ancestor approximately 15 000 years ago, possibly owing to isolation during a recent glacial advance. The continental steamer duck species are not reciprocally monophyletic, but show some amount of genetic differentiation between them. Each lineage of 
              Tachyeres 
              represents a different stage between flight and flightlessness. Their phylogenetic relationships suggest multiple losses of flight and/or long-term persistence of mixed-flight capability. As such, steamer ducks may provide a model system to study the evolution of flightlessness.},

	abstract = {Abstract 
            The diverse Old World avian family Ploceidae (weaverbirds) presently comprises 117 species in 17 genera. Despite being a well-known bird group, the family has received incomplete attention in terms of molecular systematics; systematists have often focused on subclades, with the most extensive study to date covering {\textless}66\% of recognized species. As a consequence, weaverbird taxonomy remains outdated, and phylogenetic relationships, particularly of the African Malimbus (previously Ploceus and Malimbus) clade, remains largely unresolved. Here, we sampled 109 weaver species (and numerous nominal subspecies), including 99 of the 103 recognized “typical weaverbird” taxa for an 8-gene dataset. Antique DNA techniques were used to extract DNA from study skins of 27 rare taxa not available in global tissue collections. The study included 32 species and 4 genera of ploceids previously unstudied phylogenetically. Our analyses supported monophyly of the family and identified 8 distinct clades. Our results conflict extensively with current taxonomy. We suggest that plumage traits and morphology exhibit high plasticity, such that phenotype does not always reflect phylogenetic relationships in weaverbirds. We recommend (1) uniting African-Ploceus, Malimbus, Anaplectes, and Notiospiza in Malimbus; (2) retaining the monotypic genus Pachyphantes; and (3) placing Brachycope with Euplectes. This study, the first near-species-level phylogeny for the family, lays a firm foundation for downstream studies of biogeography and character evolution.},

              Background 
              Divergence time estimation is fundamental to understanding many aspects of the evolution of organisms, such as character evolution, diversification, and biogeography. With the development of sequence technology, improved analytical methods, and knowledge of fossils for calibration, it is possible to obtain robust molecular dating results. However, while phylogenomic datasets show great promise in phylogenetic estimation, the best ways to leverage the large amounts of data for divergence time estimation has not been well explored. A potential solution is to focus on a subset of data for divergence time estimation, which can significantly reduce the computational burdens and avoid problems with data heterogeneity that may bias results. 
             
             
              Results 
              In this study, we obtained thousands of ultraconserved elements (UCEs) from 130 extant galliform taxa, including representatives of all genera, to determine the divergence times throughout galliform history. We tested the effects of different “gene shopping” schemes on divergence time estimation using a carefully, and previously validated, set of fossils. Our results found commonly used clock-like schemes may not be suitable for UCE dating (or other data types) where some loci have little information. We suggest use of partitioning (e.g., PartitionFinder) and selection of tree-like partitions may be good strategies to select a subset of data for divergence time estimation from UCEs. Our galliform time tree is largely consistent with other molecular clock studies of mitochondrial and nuclear loci. With our increased taxon sampling, a well-resolved topology, carefully vetted fossil calibrations, and suitable molecular dating methods, we obtained a high quality galliform time tree. 
             
             
              Conclusions 
              We provide a robust galliform backbone time tree that can be combined with more fossil records to further facilitate our understanding of the evolution of Galliformes and can be used as a resource for comparative and biogeographic studies in this group.},

            Determining the timing of diversification of modern birds has been difficult. We combined DNA sequences of clock-like genes for most avian families with 130 fossil birds to generate a new time tree for Neornithes and investigated their biogeographic and diversification dynamics. We found that the most recent common ancestor of modern birds inhabited South America around 95 million years ago, but it was not until the Cretaceous-Paleogene transition (66 million years ago) that Neornithes began to diversify rapidly around the world. Birds used two main dispersion routes: reaching the Old World through North America, and reaching Australia and Zealandia through Antarctica. Net diversification rates increased during periods of global cooling, suggesting that fragmentation of tropical biomes stimulated speciation. Thus, we found pervasive evidence that avian evolution has been influenced by plate tectonics and environmental change, two basic features of Earth’s dynamics.},

In this study, we explored how a pantropical distribution arose in a diverse clade with a rich fossil history: the avian order Coraciiformes. This group has played a central role in the debate of the biogeographical history of Neoaves. However, the order lacked a coherent species tree to inform study of its evolutionary dynamics. Here, we present the first complete species tree of Coraciiformes, produced with 4858 ultraconserved elements, which supports two clades: (1) Old World-restricted bee-eaters, rollers and ground-rollers; and (2) New World todies and motmots, and cosmopolitan kingfishers. Our results indicated two pulses of diversification: (1) major lineages of Coraciiformes arose in Laurasia approximately 57 Ma, followed by independent dispersals into equatorial regions, possibly due to tracking tropical habitat into the lower latitudes—the Coracii (Coraciidae + Brachypteraciidae) into the Afrotropics, bee-eaters throughout the Old World tropics, and kingfishers into the Australasian tropics; and (2) diversification of genera in the tropics during the Miocene and Pliocene. Our study supports the important role of Laurasia as the geographical origin of a major pantropical lineage and provides a new framework for comparative analyses in this charismatic bird radiation.},

However, island colonization has traditionally been considered an evolutionary dead-end process, and its consequences for continental biodiversity remain understudied. Here, we use the evolutionary radiation of Columbiformes (i.e. pigeons and doves) to examine if ecological niche shifts on islands shaped biological diversification and community composition on continents. We show that the colonization of islands by continental, terrestrial-foraging lineages led to the exploitation of a new ecological niche (i.e. arboreal foraging). This transition towards arboreal foraging was associated with evolutionary adaptation towards a new morphological optimum. In addition, arboreal-foraging lineages of islands experienced an increase in speciation rates, which was associated with successful range expansions to other islands as well as back colonization of continents. Our results provide empirical evidence that diversification on continents can only be fully understood when studying the diversification processes that took place on islands, challenging the view of islands as mere sinks of evolutionary diversity.},

              Despite tremendous efforts in the past decades, relationships among main avian lineages remain heavily debated without a clear resolution. Discrepancies have been attributed to diversity of species sampled, phylogenetic method and the choice of genomic regions 
              1–3 
              . Here we address these issues by analysing the genomes of 363 bird species 
              4 
              (218 taxonomic families, 92\% of total). Using intergenic regions and coalescent methods, we present a well-supported tree but also a marked degree of discordance. The tree confirms that Neoaves experienced rapid radiation at or near the Cretaceous–Palaeogene boundary. Sufficient loci rather than extensive taxon sampling were more effective in resolving difficult nodes. Remaining recalcitrant nodes involve species that are a challenge to model due to either extreme DNA composition, variable substitution rates, incomplete lineage sorting or complex evolutionary events such as ancient hybridization. Assessment of the effects of different genomic partitions showed high heterogeneity across the genome. We discovered sharp increases in effective population size, substitution rates and relative brain size following the Cretaceous–Palaeogene extinction event, supporting the hypothesis that emerging ecological opportunities catalysed the diversification of modern birds. The resulting phylogenetic estimate offers fresh insights into the rapid radiation of modern birds and provides a taxon-rich backbone tree for future comparative studies.},

	abstract = {Avian diversification has been influenced by global climate change, plate tectonic movements, and mass extinction events. However, the impact of these factors on the diversification of the hyperdiverse perching birds (passerines) is unclear because family level relationships are unresolved and the timing of splitting events among lineages is uncertain. We analyzed DNA data from 4,060 nuclear loci and 137 passerine families using concatenation and coalescent approaches to infer a comprehensive phylogenetic hypothesis that clarifies relationships among all passerine families. Then, we calibrated this phylogeny using 13 fossils to examine the effects of different events in Earth history on the timing and rate of passerine diversification. Our analyses reconcile passerine diversification with the fossil and geological records; suggest that passerines originated on the Australian landmass ∼47 Ma; and show that subsequent dispersal and diversification of passerines was affected by a number of climatological and geological events, such as Oligocene glaciation and inundation of the New Zealand landmass. Although passerine diversification rates fluctuated throughout the Cenozoic, we find no link between the rate of passerine diversification and Cenozoic global temperature, and our analyses show that the increases in passerine diversification rate we observe are disconnected from the colonization of new continents. Taken together, these results suggest more complex mechanisms than temperature change or ecological opportunity have controlled macroscale patterns of passerine speciation.},

              Aim 
              The species diversity and endemism of tropical biotas are major contributors to global biodiversity, but the factors underlying the formation of these systems remain poorly understood. 
             
             
              Location 
              The world's largest tropical island, New Guinea. 
             
             
              Time period 
              Miocene to present. 
             
             
              Major taxa studied 
              Passerine birds. 
             
             
              Methods 
              We first generated a species‐level phylogeny of all native breeding passerine birds to analyse spatial and elevational patterns of species richness, species age and phylogenetic diversity. Second, we used an existing dataset on bill morphology to analyse spatial and elevational patterns of functional diversity. 
             
             
              Results 
              The youngest New Guinean species are principally distributed in the lowlands and outlying mountain ranges, with the lowlands also maintaining the majority of non‐endemic species. In contrast, many species occurring in the central mountain range are phylogenetically distinct, range‐restricted, endemic lineages. Centres of accumulation for the oldest species are in montane forest, with these taxa having evolved unique bill forms in comparison to the remaining New Guinean species. For the morphological generalists, attaining a highland distribution does not necessarily represent the end to dispersal and diversification, because a number of new species have formed in the outlying mountain ranges, following recent colonization from the central range. 
             
             
              Main conclusions 
              We conclude that a general model of tropical montane diversification is that lineages commonly colonize the lowlands, shifting their ranges upslope through time to become range‐restricted montane forest endemics, attaining novel functional adaptations to these environments.},

            Encompassing some of the major hotspots of biodiversity on Earth, large mountain systems have long held the attention of evolutionary biologists. The region of the Qinghai‐Tibet Plateau (QTP) is considered a biogeographic source for multiple colonization events into adjacent areas including the northern Palearctic. The faunal exchange between the QTP and adjacent regions could thus represent a one‐way street (“out of” the QTP). However, immigration into the QTP region has so far received only little attention, despite its potential to shape faunal and floral communities of the QTP. In this study, we investigated centers of origin and dispersal routes between the QTP, its forested margins and adjacent regions for five clades of alpine and montane birds of the passerine superfamily Passeroidea. We performed an ancestral area reconstruction using BioGeoBEARS and inferred a time‐calibrated backbone phylogeny for 279 taxa of Passeroidea. The oldest endemic species of the QTP was dated to the early Miocene (ca. 20 Ma). Several additional QTP endemics evolved in the mid to late Miocene (12–7 Ma). The inferred centers of origin and diversification for some of our target clades matched the “out of Tibet hypothesis’ or the “out of Himalayas hypothesis” for others they matched the “into Tibet hypothesis.” Three radiations included multiple independent Pleistocene colonization events to regions as distant as the Western Palearctic and the Nearctic. We conclude that faunal exchange between the QTP and adjacent regions was bidirectional through time, and the QTP region has thus harbored both centers of diversification and centers of immigration.},

Supertree methods solve that challenge because they facilitate a divide-and-conquer approach for large-scale phylogeny inference by integrating smaller subtrees in a computationally efficient manner. Here, we combined information from sequence capture and whole-genome phylogenies using supertree methods. However, the available phylogenomic trees had limited overlap so we used taxon-rich (but not phylogenomic) megaphylogenies to weave them together. This allowed us to construct a phylogenomic supertree, with support values, that included 707 bird species ({\textasciitilde}7\% of avian species diversity). We estimated branch lengths using mitochondrial sequence data and we used these branch lengths to estimate divergence times. Our time-calibrated supertree supports radiation of all three major avian clades (Palaeognathae, Galloanseres, and Neoaves) near the Cretaceous-Paleogene (K-Pg) boundary. The approach we used will permit the continued addition of taxa to this supertree as new phylogenomic data are published, and it could be applied to other taxa as well.},

            The complex island archipelagoes of Wallacea and Melanesia have provided empirical data behind integral theories in evolutionary biology, including allopatric speciation and island biogeography. Yet, questions regarding the relative impact of the layered biogeographic barriers, such as deep-water trenches and isolated island systems, on faunal diversification remain underexplored. One such barrier is Wallace’s Line, a significant biogeographic boundary that largely separates Australian and Asian biodiversity. To assess the relative roles of biogeographic barriers—specifically isolated island systems and Wallace’s Line—we investigated the tempo and mode of diversification in a diverse avian radiation, Corvides (Crows and Jays, Birds-of-paradise, Vangas, and allies). We combined a genus-level data set of thousands of ultraconserved elements (UCEs) and a species-level, 12-gene Sanger sequence matrix to produce a well-resolved supermatrix tree that we leveraged to explore the group’s historical biogeography and the effects of the biogeographic barriers on their macroevolutionary dynamics. The tree is well resolved and differs substantially from what has been used extensively for past comparative analyses within this group. We confirmed that Corvides, and its major constituent clades, arose in Australia and that a burst of dispersals west across Wallace’s Line occurred after the uplift of Wallacea during the mid-Miocene. We found that dispersal across this biogeographic barrier was generally rare, though westward dispersals were two times more frequent than eastward dispersals. Wallacea’s central position between Sundaland and Sahul no doubt acted as a bridge for island-hopping dispersal out of Australia, across Wallace’s Line, to colonize the rest of Earth. In addition, we found that the complex island archipelagoes east of Wallace’s Line harbor the highest rates of net diversification and are a substantial source of colonists to continental systems on both sides of this biogeographic barrier. Our results support emerging evidence that island systems, particularly the geologically complex archipelagoes of the Indo-pacific, are drivers of species diversification.

              The role of the environment in the origin of new species has long been debated. Harvey 
              et al. 
              examined the evolutionary history and species diversity of suboscine birds in the tropics (see the Perspective by Morlon). Contrary to expectations that the tropics have higher rates of speciation, the authors observed that higher and more constant speciation rates occur in harsh environments relative to the tropics. Thus, for this group of birds, diversification in temperate to Arctic regions followed by the movement and retention of species in the tropics results in their higher local levels of species diversity.

            The tropics are the source of most biodiversity yet inadequate sampling obscures answers to fundamental questions about how this diversity evolves. We leveraged samples assembled over decades of fieldwork to study diversification of the largest tropical bird radiation, the suboscine passerines. Our phylogeny, estimated using data from 2389 genomic regions in 1940 individuals of 1283 species, reveals that peak suboscine species diversity in the Neotropics is not associated with high recent speciation rates but rather with the gradual accumulation of species over time. Paradoxically, the highest speciation rates are in lineages from regions with low species diversity, which are generally cold, dry, unstable environments. Our results reveal a model in which species are forming faster in environmental extremes but have accumulated in moderate environments to form tropical biodiversity hotspots.},

            Gene tree discordance is expected in phylogenomic trees and biological processes are often invoked to explain it. However, heterogeneous levels of phylogenetic signal among individuals within data sets may cause artifactual sources of topological discordance. We examined how the information content in tips and subclades impacts topological discordance in the parrots (Order: Psittaciformes), a diverse and highly threatened clade of nearly 400 species. Using ultraconserved elements from 96\% of the clade’s species-level diversity, we estimated concatenated and species trees for 382 ingroup taxa. We found that discordance among tree topologies was most common at nodes dating between the late Miocene and Pliocene, and often at the taxonomic level of the genus. Accordingly, we used two metrics to characterize information content in tips and assess the degree to which conflict between trees was being driven by lower-quality samples. Most instances of topological conflict and nonmonophyletic genera in the species tree could be objectively identified using these metrics. For subclades still discordant after tip-based filtering, we used a machine learning approach to determine whether phylogenetic signal or noise was the more important predictor of metrics supporting the alternative topologies. We found that when signal favored one of the topologies, the noise was the most important variable in poorly performing models that favored the alternative topology. In sum, we show that artifactual sources of gene tree discordance, which are likely a common phenomenon in many data sets, can be distinguished from biological sources by quantifying the information content in each tip and modeling which factors support each topology.

              Stonechats (genus 
              Saxicola 
              ) are passerine birds with an extraordinarily large breeding distribution. Recent studies provide strong evidence that the taxon shows far greater geographic differentiation than originally suspected, with African, Siberian and European stonechats forming distinct, monophyletic groups that have been suggested to be species in their own right. Here, we present additional data on the geographic differentiation among African stonechats, 
              Saxicola torquatus 
              . Nucleotide sequences of the mitochondrial NADH dehydrogenase subunit 2 and cytochrome

              Saxicola t. sibilla

              Saxicola tectes

In part, this has arisen from the scarcity of rigorous tests for mechanisms promoting speciation, and from major uncertainties about palaeogeographic events and their spatial and temporal associations with diversification. Here, we investigate the environmental history of Amazonia using a phylogenetic and biogeographic analysis of trumpeters (Aves: 
              Psophia

We employ this temporally calibrated phylogeny to test competing palaeogeographic hypotheses. Our results are consistent with the establishment of the current Amazonian drainage system at approximately 3.0–2.0 Ma and predict the temporal pattern of major river formation over Plio-Pleistocene times. We propose a palaeobiogeographic model for the last 3.0 Myr of Amazonian history that has implications for understanding patterns of endemism, the temporal history of Amazonian diversification and mechanisms promoting speciation. The history of 
              Psophia

            Prinias (Cisticolidae: Prinia) are resident warblers of open areas across Africa and Asia and include many polytypic species whose species limits have not been seriously reevaluated recently. Based on an integrative taxonomic analysis of morphology, song, and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), we suggest that 2 species should be recognized in the Graceful Prinia (Prinia gracilis) complex. In addition, our morphological analyses show the existence of a well-marked undescribed form in southeastern Somalia, which we name herein as a new subspecies. Prinia gracilis is a small, drab, long-tailed species with streaking above and plain pale underparts that has been suggested to fall into 2 groups: the southwestern nominate group (from Egypt to Oman) and the northeastern lepida group (from Turkey through India). However, the characters presented to justify this grouping are variable and show a mosaic pattern, and whether genetic and vocal differences exist is unknown. We found consistent between-group song differences, with the nominate group giving consistently longer inter-phrase intervals, whereas the members of the lepida group sing an essentially continuous reel. An mtDNA tree suggests a deep split between the nominate and lepida groups, with a coalescence time between these clades of {\textasciitilde} 2.2 million years ago. Vocal and mtDNA analyses provided evidence that the northeastern Arabian Peninsula taxon carpenteri belongs to the lepida group. We found that, of all the morphological characters proposed, only proportions and tail barring and spotting relatively consistently distinguish the 2 groups. However, these characters strongly suggest that the eastern Arabian Peninsula is populated by taxa of both the gracilis and lepida groups, in different areas, but we lack genetic and bioacoustic data to corroborate this. Although further study is needed in potential contact zones, we suggest that 2 species should be recognized in the P. gracilis complex, and we propose the retention of the English name Graceful Prinia for P. gracilis sensu stricto, while we suggest that P. lepida be known as Delicate Prinia.},

Further, each tree identified thrushes (Turdidae) as the closest relative to Cinclidae. Based on relationships within 
              Cinclus 
              , a Eurasian ancestral area is proposed, with subsequent movement into the New World. Dating of species divergences suggest that dippers arose approximately 4 mya, and achieved their present continental distributions soon after.},

	abstract = {In this study, we apply a genome‐scale set of molecular markers, ultraconserved elements, to fully resolve the phylogeny of a family of secretive, nocturnal birds, the potoos (Nyctibiidae). This dataset provides an opportunity to explore some challenges of phylogenetic analyses of genome‐scale datasets, which we address in several ways. We generate data matrices ranging between 2610–4175 loci (1 477 319–3 848 295 aligned base pairs) that represent versions of the data differing in whether or not alignments were trimmed prior to concatenation, and whether 100 or 75\% of all taxa were required to be represented by data for inclusion of a given locus. These matrices are analyzed with both maximum likelihood and coalescent algorithms, to check for artifacts of concatenation. Then, we subsample our data matrix by locus into randomly‐selected replicates of 125–1000 loci, and compare the topologies and statistical support of the resulting trees to look for evidence of systematic error. In analyses of complete matrices, we find strong statistical support for all ingroup nodes of the tree with no evidence for systematic error introduced by alignment trimming, missing data, or concatenation. We find further support for that topology in our subsampling analyses and statistical topology tests. The earliest branch of the tree separates 
              Nyctibius bracteatus 
              from the rest of the potoos, followed successively by 
              N. grandis

              plus 
              N. aethereus

	abstract = {The evolution of the ratite birds has been widely attributed to vicariant speciation, driven by the Cretaceous breakup of the supercontinent Gondwana. The early isolation of Africa and Madagascar implies that the ostrich and extinct Madagascan elephant birds (Aepyornithidae) should be the oldest ratite lineages. We sequenced the mitochondrial genomes of two elephant birds and performed phylogenetic analyses, which revealed that these birds are the closest relatives of the New Zealand kiwi and are distant from the basal ratite lineage of ostriches. This unexpected result strongly contradicts continental vicariance and instead supports flighted dispersal in all major ratite lineages. We suggest that convergence toward gigantism and flightlessness was facilitated by early Tertiary expansion into the diurnal herbivory niche after the extinction of the dinosaurs. 
          ,  
            Elephant bird mitochondrial sequences suggest that flightless bird ancestors were able to fly and dispersed through flight

            Ruffling ancient ratite feathers 
             
              Biologists have often pointed to the breakup of the supercontinent Gondwana to explain how related species ended up on far-flung continents, but as new research shows, that explanation doesn't fly with ratite birds. Ratite birds are a lineage of large, mostly flightless birds including the African ostrich, the Australian emu, the South American rhea, the diminutive New Zealand kiwi, and the extinct Madagascar elephant bird. Mitchell 
              et al. 
              examined the phylogeny of these birds, adding ancient mitochondrial DNA sequences from the extinct elephant bird. It seems that ratites originated from flighted ancestors who evolved large sizes and loss of flight only after flying to their new homes.

              complex using molecular, morphological and vocal analyses. The extensive seasonal, sexual, age‐related, geographical and taxon‐specific variation in this complex has never before been adequately studied. As no previous genetic or vocal analyses have focused on this group, misinterpretation of taxonomic signals from limited conventional morphological study alone was likely. Using mitochondrial and nuclear

              and Chinese 
              striata

              P. p. cooki 
              are morphologically and vocally most similar to and most closely related to Javan 
              P. p. polychroa 
              , and require a new name, proposed here. 
              Prinia p. bangsi

	abstract = {Western New Guinea remains one of the last biologically underexplored regions of the world, and much remains to be learned regarding the diversity and evolutionary history of its fauna and flora. During a recent ornithological expedition to the Kumawa Mountains in West Papua, we encountered an undescribed species of 
              Melanocharis 
              berrypecker (Melanocharitidae) in cloud forest at an elevation of 1200 m asl. Its main characteristics are iridescent blue‐black upperparts, satin‐white underparts washed lemon yellow, and white outer edges to the external rectrices. Initially thought to represent a close relative of the Mid‐mountain Berrypecker 
              Melanocharis longicauda 
              based on elevation and plumage colour traits, a complete phylogenetic analysis of the genus based on full mitogenomes and genome‐wide nuclear data revealed that the new species, which we name Satin Berrypecker 
              Melanocharis citreola 
              sp. nov., is in fact sister to the phenotypically dissimilar Streaked Berrypecker 
              Melanocharis striativentris 
              . Phylogenetic relationships within the family Melanocharitidae, including all presently recognized genera ( 
              Toxorhamphus, Oedistoma, Rhamphocharis 
              and 
              Melanocharis 
              ), reveal that this family endemic to the island of New Guinea diversified during the main uplift of New Guinea in the Middle and Late Miocene (14.6 Mya), and represents an evolutionary radiation with high disparity in bill morphology and signalling traits across species. 
              Rhamphocharis 
              berrypeckers fall within the 
              Melanocharis 
              clade despite their larger beaks and should be included in the latter genus. Interspecific genetic distances in 
              Melanocharis 
              are pronounced (average interspecific distance: 8.8\% in COI, 12.4\% in ND2), suggesting a long history of independent evolution of all lineages corresponding to currently recognized species, including the Satin Berrypecker, which shares a most recent common ancestor with its sister species in the early Pleistocene (˜ 2.0 Mya).},

              We studied the phylogenetic relationships in the genus

Our results support the monophyly of the genus

            We compared sequences of mitochondrial cytochrome-b and ND5 genes in a phylogenetic analysis of seven species of jacanas, representing all six genera and including the Greater Painted-snipe (Rostratula benghalensis) as an outgroup. When analyzed separately by parsimony and maximum-likelihood bootstrapping, the two genes produced consistent trees, although the ND5 tree was better resolved than the cytochrome-b tree. When combined, the data from the two genes produced a fully resolved tree that was identical to the ND5 tree. This tree had the following form: ((((Irediparra, Microparra), Metopidius), Actophilornis), ((Jacana jacana, J. spinosa), Hydrophasianus)), Rostratula. The phylogeny consists of two major clades that were known to traditional and phylogenetic taxonomists. It also contains sister taxa that are geographically disjunct: the New World Jacana and Asian Hydrophasianus, and the African Microparra and Australian Irediparra. We postulate that this biogeographic pattern results from the extinction of intervening African and Asian taxa, respectively.},

	abstract = {Penguins are a remarkable group of birds, with the 18 extant species living in diverse climatic zones from the tropics to Antarctica. The timing of the origin of these extant penguins remains controversial. Previous studies based on DNA sequences and fossil records have suggested widely differing times for the origin of the group. This has given rise to widely differing biogeographic narratives about their evolution. To resolve this problem, we sequenced five introns from 11 species representing all genera of living penguins. Using these data and other available DNA sequences, together with the ages of multiple penguin fossils to calibrate the molecular clock, we estimated the age of the most recent common ancestor of extant penguins to be 20.4 Myr (17.0–23.8 Myr). This time is half of the previous estimates based on molecular sequence data. Our results suggest that most of the major groups of extant penguins diverged 11–16 Ma. This overlaps with the sharp decline in Antarctic temperatures that began approximately 12 Ma, suggesting a possible relationship between climate change and penguin evolution.},

              The temporal origins of the extraordinary biodiversity of the Neotropical region are highly debated. Recent empirical work has found support for alternative models on the tempo of speciation in Neotropical species further fuelling the debate. However, relationships within many Neotropical lineages are poorly understood, and it is unclear how this uncertainty impacts inferences on the evolution of taxa in the region. We examined the robustness of diversification patterns in the avian genus 
              Forpus 
              by testing whether the use of different units of biodiversity (i.e. biological species and statistically inferred species) impacted diversification rates and inferences regarding important biogeographic breaks in the genus. We found that the best‐fit model of diversification for the biological species data set was a declining rate of diversification; whereas a model of constant diversification was the best‐fit model for statistically inferred species or subspecies. Moreover, the relative importance of different landscape features in delimiting genetic structure across the landscape varied across data sets with differing units of biodiversity. Patterns based on divergence times among biological species indicated old speciation events across major geographic and river barriers. In contrast, data sets more inclusive of the diversity in 
              Forpus 
              illustrate the role of both old divergence across major landscape features and more recent divergences that are possibly attributed to Pleistocene climatic changes. Overall, these results indicate that conflicting models on the temporal origins of Neotropical birds may be attributable to sampling biases.},

              Aim  
              We present a molecular phylogenetic analysis of 
              Brotogeris 
              (Psittacidae) using several distinct and complementary approaches: we test the monophyly of the genus, delineate the basal taxa within it, uncover their phylogenetic relationships, and finally, based on these results, we perform temporal and spatial comparative analyses to help elucidate the historical biogeography of the Neotropical region. 
             
             
              Location  
              Neotropical lowlands, including dry and humid forests. 
             
             
              Methods  
              Phylogenetic relationships within 
              Brotogeris 
              were investigated using the complete sequences of the mitochondrial genes cyt 
              b 
              and ND2, and partial sequences of the nuclear intron 7 of the gene for Beta Fibrinogen for all eight species and 12 of the 17 taxa recognized within the genus (total of 63 individuals). In order to delinetae the basal taxa within the genus we used both molecular and plumage variation, the latter being based on the examination of 597 skin specimens. Dates of divergence and confidence intervals were estimated using penalized likelihood. Spatial and temporal comparative analyses were performed including several closely related parrot genera. 
             
             
              Results  
              Brotogeris 
              was found to be a monophyletic genus, sister to 
              Myiopsitta. 
              The phylogenetic analyses recovered eight well‐supported clades representing the recognized biological species. Although some described subspecies are diagnosably distinct based on morphology, there was generally little intraspecific mtDNA variation. The Amazonian species had different phylogenetic affinities and did not group in a monophyletic clade. 
              Brotogeris 
              diversification took place during the last 6 Myr, the same time‐frame as previously found for 
              Pionus 
              and 
              Pyrilia 
              . 
             
             
              Main conclusions  
              The biogeographical history of 
              Brotogeris 
              implies a dynamic history for South American biomes since the Pliocene. It corroborates the idea that the geological evolution of Amazonia has been important in shaping its biodiversity, argues against the idea that the region has been environmentally stable during the Quaternary, and suggests dynamic interactions between wet and dry forest habitats in South America, with representatives of the Amazonian biota having several independent close relationships with taxa endemic to other biomes.},

            We reconstructed the phylogeny and estimated mitochondrial DNA diversity to assess levels of divergence and population structure in the Black-spotted Barbet complex. This complex consists of three Amazonian taxa: Capito niger, C. auratus, and C. brunneipectus. Sequence divergence between these taxa is relatively high and all are monophyletic, which is consistent with the classification of these taxa as distinct species. Within C. auratus, a relatively deep split in the gene tree yields two reciprocally monophyletic groups separated by the Amazon, Solimões, and Ucayali Rivers. Apparently, these rivers serve as an effective barrier to mtDNA gene flow between these populations of C. auratus. Carotenoid plumage coloration did not contain phylogenetic information for this group and several subspecies of C. auratus named on the basis of such coloration were not monophyletic based on mtDNA comparisons. However, mtDNA variation suggests that C. auratus contains at least two evolutionarily significant units which might indicate two geographically separate species-level taxa. 
            Variación Geográfica en las Secuencias de ADN Mitocondrial de un Ave no Paserina Amazónica: el Complejo de Capito niger 
            Resumen. Reconstruimos la filogenia y estimamos la diversidad de ADN mitocondrial del complejo de Capito niger para evaluar los niveles de divergencia y la estructura poblacional. Este complejo consiste en tres taxa amazónicos: Capito niger, C. auratus y C. brunneipectus. La divergencia en las secuencias entre estos taxa es relativamente alta y todos son monofiléticos, lo cual concuerda con la clasificación de estos taxa como especies distintas. Dentro de C. auratus, el árbol génico tiene una división relativamente profunda en dos grupos recíprocamente monofiléticos que están separados por los ríos Amazonas, Solimões y Ucayali. Aparentemente, estos ríos sirven como una barrera eficaz que impiden el flujo genético de ADN mitocondrial entre estas poblaciones de C. auratus. La coloración carotenoide del plumaje no proveyó información filogenética para este grupo, y varias subespecies de C. auratus nombradas con base en este tipo de coloración no fueron monofiléticas según comparaciones de ADN mitocondrial. Sin embargo, la variación de ADN mitocondrial sugiere que C. auratus contiene por lo menos dos unidades evolutivas, las cuales podrían ser dos especies geográficamente separadas.},

              Elminia 
              has had a jumbled taxonomic history, being placed among ‘old world flycatchers’ or ‘monarch flycatchers’, where it was for a long time lumped with 
              Trochocercus 
              . It was recently suggested that it might represent a deep clade in the large sylvioid radiation. Using one mitochondrial protein‐coding gene (ND2, 1041 bp) and one nuclear intron (myoglobin intron 2, 700 bp) DNA sequences, we obtained robust evidence for the phylogenetic placement of 
              Elminia 
              in the new family Stenostiridae, which is strongly supported by a synapomorphic insertion of one base in the nuclear myoglobin intron 2 sequence. Our analyses confirm the monophyly of 
              Elminia 
              and resolve relationships within this genus, but cannot confidently identify its sister‐taxon within the stenostirid clade. Two clades were strongly supported within the genus 
              Elminia 
              : one with the two fairy blue flycatchers and another with the three white‐tailed crested‐flycatchers. Within the first clade, 
              Elminia longicauda 
              appears non‐monophyletic but remains strongly related to 
              E. albicauda 
              . In the second clade, 
              E. albiventris 
              is sister to 
              E. albonotata

              . 
              nigromitrata 
              ) appears in a basal position within this clade. According to our molecular dating, several geological events in western Africa and the Albertine Rift area seem to be related to the historical distribution of Elminia. Thus, the differentiation between 
              E. albonotata 
              and 
              E. albiventris 
              could be directly related to the tectonic history of these two regions. According to our molecular dating, at least one intercontinental dispersal event involving 
              Culicicapa 
              took place within the Stenostiridae clade at a time when the Middle East was forested.},

            Phylogenetic relationships among the antpitta genera were studied using DNA sequence data from the mitochondrial genome. The clade representing the traditional “antpitta” genera (Grallaria, Grallaricula, Hylopezus, Myrmothera, and Pittasoma) was found to be paraphyletic, owing to the sister relationship of Pittasoma and Conopophaga. In a previously unreported relationship, Pittasoma was strongly supported as the sister genus to Conopophaga (Conopophagidae). The remaining antpitta genera form a fully resolved and well-supported monophyletic lineage with two major subclades. The first clade consists of the genus Grallaria and supports the subgenera identified by Lowery and O'Neill (1969). The second antpitta clade has Hylopezus as the sister genus to Myrmothera, with Grallaricula as their sister genus. The results here allow for a new interpretation of the morphological characters used in previous studies.},

            Parakeets in the genus Pyrrhura occur in Amazonia and in almost all other major Neotropical forests. Their uneven distribution (with some widespread and several geographically restricted endemic taxa) and complex patterns of plum- age variation have long generated a confused taxonomy. Several taxonomically difficult polytypic species are usually recognized. Here, we present a mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) phylogenetic analysis of Pyrrhura, with emphasis on the especially problematic picta-leucotis complex, to provide a more robust basis for interpreting the systematics and historical biogeography of the group. Our main findings are that (1) Pyrrhura can be divided into three main evolutionary lineages, one comprising P. cruentata, an Atlantic Forest endemic, the second comprising the picta-leucotis complex, and the third comprising the remaining species; (2) the traditionally recognized species P. picta and P. leucotis are not monophyletic; and (3) most of the species recognized by Joseph (2000, 2002) are diagnosable as independent evolutionary units, with the exception of the following species pairs: P. snethlageae and P. amazonum, P. leucotis and P. griseipectus, and P. roseifrons and P. peruviana. Other than P. cruentata, the two clades that constitute Pyrrhura appear to have radiated and evolved their present mtDNA diversity over short periods during the Plio-Pleistocene.

              Aim  
              Zoogeographic patterns in the Himalayas and their neighbouring Southeast Asian mountain ranges include elevational parapatry and ecological segregation, particularly among passerine bird species. We estimate timings of lineage splits among close relatives from the north Palaearctic, the Sino‐Himalayan mountain forests and from adjacent Southeast Asia. We also compare phylogeographic affinities and timing of radiation among members of avian communities from different elevational belts. 
             
             
              Location  
              East Asia. 
             
             
              Methods  
              We reconstructed molecular phylogenies based on a mitochondrial marker (cytochrome 
              b 
              ) and multilocus data sets for seven passerine groups: Aegithalidae, Certhiidae ( 
              Certhia 
              ), Fringillidae ( 
              Pyrrhula 
              ), Paridae ( 
              Periparus 
              ), Phylloscopidae, Regulidae and Timaliidae ( 
              Garrulax sensu lato 
              ). Molecular dating was carried out using a Bayesian approach applying a relaxed clock in 
              beast 
              . Time estimates were inferred from three independent calibrations based on either a fixed mean substitution rate or fixed node ages. The biogeographic history of each group was reconstructed using a parsimony‐based approach. 
             
             
              Results  
              Passerine radiation in Southeast Asia can be divided into roughly three major phases of separation events. We infer that an initial Miocene radiation within the Southeast Asian region included invasions of (sub)tropical faunal elements from the Indo‐Burmese region to the Himalayan foothills and further successive invasions to Central Asia and Taiwan towards the early Pliocene. During two further Pliocene/Pleistocene phases, the subalpine mountain belt of the Sino‐Himalayas was initially invaded by boreal species with clear phylogenetic affinities to the north Palaearctic taiga belt. Most terminal splits between boreal Himalayan/Chinese sister taxa were dated to the Pleistocene. 
             
             
              Main conclusions  
              Extant patterns of elevational parapatry and faunal transition in the Sino‐Himalayas originated from successive invasions from different climatic regions. The initiation of Southeast Asian passerine diversification and colonization of the Himalayan foothills in the mid‐Miocene coincides with the postulated onset of Asian monsoon climate and the resulting floral and faunal turnovers. Patterns of elevational parapatry were established by southward invasions of boreal avifaunal elements to the subalpine Sino‐Himalayan forest belt that were strongly connected to climate cooling towards the end of the Pliocene. Current patterns of allopatry and parapatry in boreal species (groups) were shaped through Pleistocene forest fragmentation in East Asia.},

              Our objective was to elucidate the biogeography and speciation patterns in an entire avian family, which shows a complex pattern of overlapping and nonoverlapping geographical distributions, and much variation in plumage, but less in size and structure. We estimated the phylogeny and divergence times for all of the world's species of 
              Prunella 
              based on multiple genetic loci, and analyzed morphometric divergence and biogeographical history. The common ancestor of 
              Prunella 
              was present in the Sino‐Himalayan Mountains or these mountains and Central Asia–Mongolia more than 9 million years ago (mya), but a burst of speciations took place during the mid‐Pliocene to early Pleistocene. The relationships among the six primary lineages resulting from that differentiation are unresolved, probably because of the rapid radiation. A general increase in sympatry with increasing time since divergence is evident. With one exception, species in clades younger than c. 3.7 my are allopatric. Species that are widely sympatric, including the most recently diverged (2.4 mya) sympatric sisters, are generally more divergent in size/structure than allo‐/parapatric close relatives. The distributional pattern and inferred ages suggest divergence in allopatry and substantial waiting time until secondary contact, likely due to competitive exclusion. All sympatrically breeding species are ecologically segregated, as suggested by differences in size/structure and habitat. Colonizations of new areas were facilitated during glacial periods, followed by fragmentation during interglacials—contrary to the usual view that glacial periods resulted mainly in fragmentations.},

              Molecular systematics is bringing taxonomy into the 21st Century by updating our nomenclature to reflect phylogenetic relationships of taxa. This transformation is evidenced by massive changes in avian taxonomy, ranging from ordinal to subspecies changes. In this study, we employ target capture of ultraconserved elements to resolve genus‐level systematics of a problematic group of honeyeaters (Aves: Meliphagidae). With near complete species‐level taxon sampling of the Australo‐Papuan species within the traditionally recognized 
              Meliphaga 
              and 
              Oreornis 
              , we investigate generic limits using a genomic dataset. Likelihood and species tree methods confirm two clades within this group and found the New Guinea endemic 
              Oreornis chrysogenys 
              embedded within one of these clades. Our study supports earlier recommendations that 
              Meliphaga 
              Lewin, 1808 should be restricted to three species, 
              M. aruensis

	abstract = {Abstract 
            The curassows comprise 14 species of sedentary Neotropical birds classified in four genera (Crax, Nothocrax, Mitu, and Pauxi) in the family Cracidae. Congeneric species have a striking pattern of allopatric distributions that might be attributable to vicariance, dispersal, or a combination of the two. To test those biogeographic hypotheses, a strongly supported phylogeny was needed, so that existing problems of taxonomic rank could be solved and a better understanding of the group's evolutionary history attained. We therefore estimated the phylogenetic relationships of all 14 species, on the basis of 6,929 sites of six different mitochondrial DNA regions, and reassessed the status of the four genera. Sequences from the ND4 gene favored a tree that was highly incongruent with the tree recovered using the other five gene regions. However, when the ND4 sequences were concatenated with the sequences of the other genes, the optimal phylogeny was unchanged from that derived for the other genes. That combined tree was divided into two well-supported clades: one containing the seven species of Crax and the other containing the monospecific genus Nothocrax, as sister to a clade of the Mitu and Pauxi species. Mitu and Pauxi are not reciprocally monophyletic, which appears to be attributable to a distant hybridization event and a transfer of Mitu mtDNA into P. unicornis. We estimated divergence times; the diversification of curassow seems to have occurred from the Middle Miocene to the end of the Pliocene (9.5 to 1.6 Ma). Vicariance—following marine transgressions, the rise of the Andes, and subsequent changes in river basins in South America—seems to be the major mode of isolation that favored allopatric speciation in the group.},

              We describe a phylogenetic and biogeographical pattern connecting high montane biotas to those of the lowlands, as exemplified by the exclusively montane parrot genus 
              Hapalopsittaca 
              and its lowland sister genus 
              Pyrilia 
              , both nested within Tavares 
              et al. 
              ’s “amazons and allies” clade. As 
              Hapalopsittaca 
              is the only genus within the “amazons and allies” clade that is exclusively distributed in the Andes, the optimization leads to the inference that the ancestral distribution of the branch leading to 
              Pyrilia  
              + 
               Hapalopsittaca 
              was lowland. Museum specimens were examined to determine basal diagnosably distinct taxonomic units. Based on this analysis, mitochondrial sequences (cyt 
              b 
              and ND2 genes) from 17 individuals, mostly from toe pads, and representing all basal taxa within 
              Hapalopsittaca 
              , were obtained. A divergence‐dating analysis using both nuclear (RAG‐1) and mitochondrial (cyt 
              b 
              ) genes was conducted to explore whether the uplift of the Andes coincides temporarily with the origin of this montane group, and thus might be causally linked to its origin. Molecular dating estimates the split between 
              Hapalopsittaca 
              and 
              Pyrilia 
              to have occurred between 6.6 and 8.0 Myr; thus, the timing of this highland/lowland disjunction is consistent with that of the final uplift of the Central Andes, supporting a hypothesis of vicariance due to Andean uplift. These results suggest that the taxonomic assembly of montane biotas may be, at least in part, explained by events of Earth history rather than by long‐distance dispersal and colonization. Diversification within 
              Hapalopsittaca 
              and the origin of current species are more recent in time and probably are related to Pleistocene climatic oscillations, as has been shown in other montane groups.},

              Background 
              The behavioural repertoire of every species evolved over time and its evolution can be traced through the phylogenetic relationships in distinct groups. Cranes (family Gruidae) represent a small, old, monophyletic group with well-corroborated phylogenetic relationships on the species level, and at the same time they exhibit a complex and well-described behavioural repertoire. 
             
             
              Methods 
              We therefore investigated the evolution of behavioural traits of cranes in a phylogenetic context using several phylogenetic approaches and two types of trait scoring. The cranes exhibit more than a hundred behavioural displays, almost one third of which may be phylogenetically informative. 
             
             
              Results 
               
                More than half of the analysed traits carry a significant phylogenetic signal. The ancestor of cranes already exhibited a quite complex behavioural repertoire, which remained unchanged in Balearicinae but altered greatly in Gruinae, specifically by the shedding of traits rather than their creation. Trait scoring has an influence on results within the Gruinae, primarily in genera 
                Bugeranus 
                and 
                Anthropoides

              Conclusions 
               
                Albeit the behavioural traits alone cannot be used for resolving species-level relationships within the Gruidae, when optimized on molecular tree, they can help us to detect interesting evolutionary transformations of behaviour repertoire within Gruiformes. The Limpkin ( 
                Aramus guarauna 
                ) seems to be the most enigmatic species and should be studied in detail for its behavioural repertoire, which may include some precursors of crane behavioural traits.},

              To examine the history of diversification of ‘blue’ cardinalids (Cardinalidae) across North and South America. 
             
             
              Location 
              North America (including Middle America) and South America. 
             
             
              Methods 
              We collected 163 individuals of the 14 species of blue cardinalids and generated multilocus sequence data (3193 base pairs from one mitochondrial and three nuclear genes) to infer phylogeographical structure and reconstruct time‐calibrated species trees. We then estimated the ancestral range at each divergence event and tested for temporal shifts in diversification rate. 
             
             
              Results 
              Twenty‐five lineages of blue cardinalids clustered into two major clades: one confined to North America, and a second concentrated in South America. Blue cardinalids probably originated in North America, but reconstructions were influenced by how migrant taxa were assigned to biogeographical regions. Most of the pre‐Pleistocene divergences between extant taxa occurred in the North American clade, whereas most divergences in South America and adjacent Middle America occurred during the Pleistocene. Despite these differences, the rate of diversification for both clades has been similar and relatively constant over the past 10 million years, with little geographical exchange between North and South America outside the Panamanian isthmus region. 
             
             
              Main conclusions 
              Our reconstruction of the diversification history of blue cardinalids indicates a role of both Neogene and Quaternary events in generating biotic diversity across North and South America. Although ancestral area reconstruction suggests a possible North American origin for blue cardinalids, the occurrence of seasonal migration in this group and their relatives limits inference. Our study highlights the importance of considering ecological and behavioural characteristics together with palaeogeological events in order to gain an understanding of the diversification history of widespread, mobile taxonomic groups.},

              being sister to 
              Daptrius 
              . Furthermore, very low genetic divergence was found among the four species of the genus 
              Phalcoboenus 
              , with the lowest divergence being between White‐throated Caracara 
              Phalcoboenus albogularis 
              and Mountain Caracara 
              Phalcoboenus megalopterus. 
              Our divergence time analyses revealed that the Polyborinae started to diversify in the Miocene, at about 14 Ma, and that the generalist/scavenger behaviour in the Falconidae appeared between 14 and 6.6 Ma. All speciation events within the caracaras occurred during the Pleistocene. This situation differs from the general pattern described for forest birds, in which most diversification events are older, occurring primarily in the Pliocene and Miocene.},

              Penguins have long been of interest to scientists and the general public, but their evolutionary history remains unresolved. Using genomes, we investigated the drivers of penguin diversification. We found that crown-group penguins diverged in the early Miocene in Australia/New Zealand and identified 
              Aptenodytes 
              (emperor and king penguins) as the sister group to all other extant penguins. Penguins first occupied temperate environments and then radiated to cold Antarctic waters. The Antarctic Circumpolar Current’s (ACC) intensification 11.6 Mya promoted penguin diversification and geographic expansion. We detected interspecies introgression among penguins, in some cases following the direction of the ACC, and identified genes acting on thermoregulation, oxygen metabolism, and diving capacity that underwent adaptive evolution as they progressively occupied more challenging thermal niches. 
             
          ,  
             
              Penguins are the only extant family of flightless diving birds. They currently comprise at least 18 species, distributed from polar to tropical environments in the Southern Hemisphere. The history of their diversification and adaptation to these diverse environments remains controversial. We used 22 new genomes from 18 penguin species to reconstruct the order, timing, and location of their diversification, to track changes in their thermal niches through time, and to test for associated adaptation across the genome. Our results indicate that the penguin crown-group originated during the Miocene in New Zealand and Australia, not in Antarctica as previously thought, and that 
              Aptenodytes 
              is the sister group to all other extant penguin species. We show that lineage diversification in penguins was largely driven by changing climatic conditions and by the opening of the Drake Passage and associated intensification of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC). Penguin species have introgressed throughout much of their evolutionary history, following the direction of the ACC, which might have promoted dispersal and admixture. Changes in thermal niches were accompanied by adaptations in genes that govern thermoregulation and oxygen metabolism. Estimates of ancestral effective population sizes ( 
              N 
               
                e 
               
              ) confirm that penguins are sensitive to climate shifts, as represented by three different demographic trajectories in deeper time, the most common (in 11 of 18 penguin species) being an increased

              Aim 
              Continental evolutionary radiations provide opportunities to understand how landscape evolution and biotic factors interact to generate species diversity. Additionally, understanding whether diversification dynamics differ between montane and lowland environments is a long‐standing question with few comparative analyses in the Neotropics. To address these questions, we investigated the biogeographical patterns and the evolutionary processes underlying the diversification of a songbird genus, and compared diversification dynamics of clades occurring in lowland and montane Neotropical habitats. 
             
             
              Location 
              Neotropical montane and lowland forests. 
             
             
              Taxon 
               
                Arremon 
                (Aves: Passerellidae). 
               
             
             
              Methods 
              We sequenced genomic data (ultra‐conserved elements, UCEs) of 92 individuals (including historical skin specimens) comprising 47 of 50 currently recognized subspecies in the genus and collected habitat association data to (1) build the most complete phylogenetic hypothesis for the genus to date using maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods with a concatenated matrix, and a multi‐species coalescent method based on quartets; and (2) reconstruct the evolution of their ancestral ranges, habitat association and diversification rates. 
             
             
              Results 
              All phylogenetic methods recovered essentially the same topology with strong support values for most interspecific nodes revealing relationships among species. We found evidence for a montane and humid ancestral range in Central America in the late Miocene and a later expansion into the lowlands of Central America, as well as into the lowlands and mountains of South America. Despite some temporal variation in diversification rate, we found overall similar diversification dynamics between montane and lowland clades. 
             
             
              Main conclusion 
              Species diversity within the genus is likely underestimated by the current taxonomic arrangement. The colonization of lowlands and dry forests, and expansion across South America, may have provided new geographical and ecological opportunities for speciation resulting in high species diversification. Overall diversification dynamics were comparable between montane and lowland clades, contrasting with previous studies focused on such comparisons for Neotropical birds.},

              Aim 
              Unique amongst birds, megapodes (family Megapodiidae) have exchanged the strategy of incubating eggs with the warmth of their bodies for incubation behaviours that rely entirely on environmental heat sources. Typically, mound‐builders capture heat released from the decomposition of organic materials, while burrow‐nesters lay their eggs in geothermal or solar‐heated soils. The evolutionary path towards novel incubation behaviours has led to ecological and physiological adaptations unique to megapodes. Here, we present a species tree for all extant megapodes that settles long‐standing debates about megapode evolution: namely, their biogeographical origins and ancestral nesting behaviour. 
             
             
              Location 
              Australasia. 
             
             
              Methods 
               
                A time‐calibrated multilocus species tree for all extant megapodes was constructed using * 
                beast 
                . We estimated and compared divergence dates for megapodes obtained from molecular rates, fossils, and a combination of fossils and rates. Using this tree, Bayesian estimation of ancestral nesting behaviour was conducted in 
                BayesTraits 
                and ancestral ranges were estimated in 
                BioGeo

              Results 
               
                Recent dispersal has led to the recolonization of mainland Australia and New Guinea by 
                Megapodius 
                . Bayesian estimation of ancestral states indicates that mound building is the most probable ancestral nesting behaviour in megapodes (posterior probability = 0.75). Burrow nesting was acquired early in the diversification of the family (at least 14 Ma), followed by a single switch back to mound building. 
               
             
             
              Main conclusions 
               
                Divergence dates and biogeographical reconstructions strongly suggest that dispersal, and not vicariance, led to the isolation of megapodes in Australasia. We propose that flight‐mediated dispersal to environmentally variable islands is responsible for the behavioural lability in nesting behaviours observed in some 
                Megapodius 
                species today.},

	abstract = {Abstract 
            The bowerbirds in New Guinea and Australia include species that build the largest and perhaps most elaborately decorated constructions outside of humans. The males use these courtship bowers, along with their displays, to attract females. In these species, the mating system is polygynous and the females alone incubate and feed the nestlings. The bowerbirds also include 10 species of the socially monogamous catbirds in which the male participates in most aspects of raising the young. How the bower-building behavior evolved has remained poorly understood, as no comprehensive phylogeny exists for the family. It has been assumed that the monogamous catbird clade is sister to all polygynous species. We here test this hypothesis using a newly developed pipeline for obtaining homologous alignments of thousands of exonic and intronic regions from genomic data to build a phylogeny. Our well-supported species tree shows that the polygynous, bower-building species are not monophyletic. The result suggests either that bower-building behavior is an ancestral condition in the family that was secondarily lost in the catbirds, or that it has arisen in parallel in two lineages of bowerbirds. We favor the latter hypothesis based on an ancestral character reconstruction showing that polygyny but not bower-building is ancestral in bowerbirds, and on the observation that Scenopoeetes dentirostris, the sister species to one of the bower-building clades, does not build a proper bower but constructs a court for male display. This species is also sexually monomorphic in plumage despite having a polygynous mating system. We argue that the relatively stable tropical and subtropical forest environment in combination with low predator pressure and rich food access (mostly fruit) facilitated the evolution of these unique life-history traits.

We sequenced mitochondrial and nuclear genes to reconstruct a phylogenetic hypothesis for the subfamily, which was then used to examine the utility of common taxonomic characters. The phylogenetic hypothesis reveals multiple shifts between insectivory and piscivory, as well as homoplasy in bill color and plumage color. Piscivores and insectivores are interspersed across the tree, as are blue and rufous plumage types. It is apparent that reliance on these characters to delineate genera has resulted in classifications that do not describe natural groups. The sole taxonomic character examined that defines a natural division in the subfamily, toe count, is also the one generally dismissed as non‐informative in the alcedinines, yet all species with a reduction in the number of toes form a clade. It is recommended that four genera be retained to describe the variation within pygmy kingfishers.},

We constructed a molecular phylogeny of the oscine family, Oriolidae, which is distributed from Australia through to the Old World. We used the phylogeny to assess direction and timing of dispersal and whether dispersal can be linked with the well‐documented movements of geological terranes in the Indonesian Archipelago. We sampled 29 of 33 species of Oriolidae from fresh tissue and from toe pads from museum specimens, and examined two nuclear introns and two mitochondrial genes. Model‐based phylogenetic analyses yielded strong support for clades that generally mirrored classical systematics. Biogeographical analyses and divergence time estimates demonstrated that the family originated in the Australo‐Papuan region from where it dispersed first to Asia and then onwards to Africa and the Philippines before back‐colonising Asia and the Indonesian archipelago. Thus, contrary to several other avian families in the region, Oriolidae represents a sequential dispersal pattern from Australia to Africa via Asia. However, it is noteworthy that the Pacific islands and archipelagos remain uncolonised and that members inhabiting Wallacea are recent colonisers suggesting that Oriolidae are poorly adapted to island life.},

            The costs of bird song incurred in a diversity of ways may result in trade‐offs in the production and maintenance of elaborate plumage ornaments. In this paper, we examine evolutionary trade‐offs between acoustic and visual signalling in trogon birds (Trogonidae). Using multiple regressions with phylogenetically independent contrasts, we found that interspecific variation in male plumage coloration was not significantly predicted by song traits (reduced by PCA) or altitude. Although plumage coloration is expected to decrease with increases in song elaboration, both groups of variables were not related. Given that song and plumage coloration traits are likely targets of sexual selection, we also examined their relationships with sexual plumage dimorphism. We found that male carotenoid‐derived coloration was positively related to sexual plumage dimorphism, suggesting that sexual selection on male carotenoid‐derived coloration may be stronger than on melanin‐ or structurally based coloration, or than on acoustic traits. Comparative studies on other bird families accounting for the effects of phylogeny as well as environmental covariates are required to test the generality of our findings in trogons.},

              While the monophyly of the largest avian order Passeriformes as well as its suborders suboscines (Tyranni) and oscines (Passeri) is well established, lower phylogenetic relationships of this fast radiated taxon have been a continuous matter of debate, especially within the suborder oscines. Many studies analyzing phylogenetic relationships of the Passeriformes using molecular markers have been published, which led to a better resolved phylogeny. Conflicting hypotheses and still remaining uncertainties, especially within the Passerida, have repeatedly stimulated further research with additional new markers. In the present study we used a combination of established molecular markers (RAG‐1, RAG‐2, c‐ 
              myc 
              ) and the recently introduced ZENK. We accomplished phylogenetic analyses using maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference, both separately for all genes and simultaneously. To assess the phylogenetic utility of the different genes in avian systematics we analyzed the influence of each data partition on the phylogenetic tree yielded by the combined approach using partitioned Bremer support. Compared with the other single gene analyses, the ZENK trees exhibited by far the best resolution and showed the lowest amount of homoplasy. Our data indicate that this gene is—at least in passerines—suitable for inference of even old taxonomic splits. 
             
            Our combined analysis yields well‐supported phylogenetic hypotheses for passerine phylogeny and apart from corroborating recently proposed hypotheses on phylogenetic relationships in the Passeriformes we provide evidence for some new hypotheses. The subdivision of the Passerida into three superfamilies, Sylvioidea, Passeroidea and Muscicapoidea, the first as sister to the two latter groups is strongly supported. We found evidence for a split between Paridae and the remaining Sylvioidea.

            The phylogeny of kingfishers was reconstructed by comparing mitochondrial and nuclear DNA sequences representing 38 ingroup species. Analysis of the combined data and the nuclear data alone recovered the Alcedininae as the basal lineage in the family. This basal arrangement, and support for many relationships within the three subfamilies, allows discussion of biogeographic issues. The Australian region and Pacific islands display the highest diversity of kingfishers, but this diversity is not a reflection of a long history in the region. Rather, high diversity and endemism in the Australian region is inferred to result from relatively recent radiations from southern Asia. The most parsimonious explanation for the origin of New World taxa is two dispersal events from the Old World. Within the large Halcyon radiation, the phylogeny is well resolved and allows evaluation of generic assignments. The phylogeny supports splitting Todiramphus from Halcyon. Todiramphus and Syma are sister taxa, as are Halcyon and Pelargopsis. Thus, merging or retaining those genera is a more subjective decision. Although not fully resolved, relationships within the alcedinines indicate that Ceyx and Alcedo, as currently delimited, are not natural groups.

            Relationships of the Neotropical finches in the genera Euphonia and Chlorophonia (Fringillidae: Euphoniinae) have been clarified by recent molecular studies, but species-level relationships within this group have not been thoroughly addressed. In this study, we sampled specimens representing every recognized species of these genera, in addition to 2 outgroup taxa, and used target enrichment to sequence thousands of ultraconserved element (UCE) loci, as well as mitochondrial DNA reconstructed from off-target reads, from each specimen to infer these relationships. We constructed both concatenation and coalescent-based estimates of phylogeny from this dataset using matrices of varying levels of completeness, and we generated a time-scaled ultrametric tree using a recently published fossil-based external calibration. We found uniformly strong support for a monophyletic subfamily Euphoniinae and genus Chlorophonia, but a paraphyletic Euphonia across UCEs and mitochondrial genomes. Otherwise, our inferred relationships were largely concordant with previous studies. Our time-tree indicated a stem divergence time of 13.8 million years ago for this lineage, followed by a relatively young crown age of only 7.1 myr. Reconstructions of biogeographic history based on this tree suggest a South American origin for crown Euphoniinae, possibly resulting from a transoceanic dispersal event from the Eastern Hemisphere, followed by 2 dispersal events into the Caribbean and as many as 6 invasions of North America coinciding with recent estimates of the age at which the Isthmus of Panama had completely formed. We recommend splitting Euphonia and resurrecting the genus Cyanophonia for the 3 blue-hooded species more closely related to Chlorophonia. Based on our results, we suspect that there is undescribed species-level diversity in at least one, possibly many, widespread and phenotypically diverse species.},

	abstract = {The woodpeckers (Piciformes: Picinae) comprise a widely distributed and species‐rich clade of birds that is strongly associated with trees for feeding, nesting, or both. Because of this association, woodpeckers provide a useful model for evaluating the impact of climatic and tectonic events on the diversification of forest birds during the Tertiary. In order to resolve the biogeographical history of the woodpeckers, we have analysed sequences from two nuclear introns and one mitochondrial gene using likelihood and Bayesian approaches. Our analyses favour a tropical Eurasian origin; divergences between African, Indo‐Malayan and New World clades with subsequent colonizations of Africa and the New World occurred synchronously during the Middle Miocene, a period corresponding to the expansion of the C4 grasses and the uplift of the Himalayan‐Tibetan plateau. The taxonomic diversification of woodpeckers at this time may be attributed to the fragmentation of forests in response to the drier climate, which in turn prevented gene flow between tropical stocks in Africa, Indo‐Malaya and the New World. Our estimates of colonization times of South America predate the closure of the Panama Isthmus and support the hypothesis of a short‐lived, terrestrial corridor at the end of the Miocene, 5.7 Myr BP.},

	abstract = {Larks constitute an avian family of exceptional cryptic diversity and striking examples of convergent evolution. Therefore, traditional morphology-based taxonomy has recurrently failed to reflect evolutionary relationships. While taxonomy ideally should integrate morphology, vocalizations, behaviour, ecology, and genetics, this can be challenging for groups that span several continents including areas that are difficult to access. Here, we combine morphometrics and mitochondrial DNA to evaluate the taxonomy of Calandrella larks, with particular focus on the African C. cinerea and the Asian C. acutirostris complexes. We describe a new range-restricted West African taxon, Calandrella cinerea rufipecta ssp. nov. (type locality: Jos, Plateau State, Nigeria), with an isolated relic population 3000 km from its closest relative in the Rift Valley. We performed molecular species delimitation, employing coalescence-based multi-rate Poisson Tree Processes (mPTP) on cytochrome b sequences across 52 currently recognized lark species, including multiple taxa currently treated as subspecies. Three species-level splits were inferred within the genus Calandrella and another 13 across other genera, primarily among fragmented sub-Saharan taxa and taxa distributed from Northwest Africa to Arabia or East Africa. Previously unknown divergences date back as far as to the Miocene, indicating the presence of currently unrecognized species. However, we stress that taxonomic decisions should not be based on single datasets, such as mitochondrial DNA, although analyses of mitochondrial DNA can be a good indicator of taxa in need of further integrative taxonomic assessment.},

	abstract = {The New World sparrows (Passerellidae) are a large, diverse group of songbirds that vary in morphology, behavior, and ecology. Thus, they are excellent for studying trait evolution in a phylogenetic framework. We examined lability versus conservatism in morphological and behavioral traits in two related clades of sparrows ( 
              Aimophila, Peucaea 
              ), and assessed whether habitat has played an important role in trait evolution. We first inferred a multi-locus phylogeny which we used to reconstruct ancestral states, and then quantified phylogenetic signal among morphological and behavioral traits in these clades and in New World sparrows more broadly. Behavioral traits have a stronger phylogenetic signal than morphological traits. Specifically, vocal duets and song structure are the most highly conserved traits, and nesting behavior appears to be maintained within clades. Furthermore, we found a strong correlation between open habitat and unpatterned plumage, complex song, and ground nesting. However, even within lineages that share the same habitat type, species vary in nesting, plumage pattern, song complexity, and duetting. Our findings highlight trade-offs between behavior, morphology, and ecology in sparrow diversification.},

	abstract = {Abstract 
            Thoroughly sampled and well-supported phylogenetic trees are essential to taxonomy and to guide studies of evolution and ecology. Despite extensive prior inquiry, a comprehensive tree of heron relationships (Aves: Ardeidae) has not yet been published. As a result, the classification of this family remains unstable, and their evolutionary history remains poorly studied. Here, we sample genome-wide ultraconserved elements (UCEs) and mitochondrial DNA sequences (mtDNA) of \&gt;90\% of extant species to estimate heron phylogeny using a combination of maximum likelihood, coalescent, and Bayesian inference methods. The UCE and mtDNA trees are mostly concordant with one another, providing a topology that resolves relationships among the 5 heron subfamilies and indicates that the genera Gorsachius, Botaurus, Ardea, and Ixobrychus are not monophyletic. We also present the first genetic data from the Forest Bittern Zonerodius heliosylus, an enigmatic species of New Guinea; our results suggest that it is a member of the genus Ardeola and not the Tigrisomatinae (tiger herons), as previously thought. Finally, we compare molecular rates between heron clades in the UCE tree with those in previously constructed mtDNA and DNA–DNA hybridization trees. We show that rate variation in the UCE tree corroborates rate patterns in the previously constructed trees—that bitterns (Ixobrychus and Botaurus) evolved comparatively faster, and some tiger herons (Tigrisoma) and the Boat-billed Heron (Cochlearius) more slowly, than other heron taxa.},

	abstract = {Abstract 
            The typical owl family (Strigidae) comprises 194 species in 28 genera, 14 of which are monotypic. Relationships within and among genera in the typical owls have been challenging to discern because mitochondrial data have produced equivocal results and because many monotypic genera have been omitted from previous molecular analyses. Here, we collected and analyzed DNA sequences of ultraconserved elements (UCEs) from 43 species of typical owls to produce concatenated and multispecies coalescent-based phylogenetic hypotheses for all but one genus in the typical owl family. Our results reveal extensive paraphyly of taxonomic groups across phylogenies inferred using different analytical approaches and suggest the genera Athene, Otus, Asio, Megascops, Bubo, and Strix are paraphyletic, whereas Ninox and Glaucidium are polyphyletic. Secondary analyses of protein-coding mitochondrial genes harvested from off-target sequencing reads and mitochondrial genomes downloaded from GenBank generally support the extent of paraphyly we observe, although some disagreements exist at higher taxonomic levels between our nuclear and mitochondrial phylogenetic hypotheses. Overall, our results demonstrate the importance of taxon sampling for understanding and describing evolutionary relationships in this group, as well as the need for additional sampling, study, and taxonomic revision of typical owl species. Additionally, our findings highlight how both divergence and convergence in morphological characters have obscured our understanding of the evolutionary history of typical owls, particularly those with insular distributions.},

It has long been debated whether the group originated in the New World or the Old World and whether their radiation is related to the expansion of open habitats and shifts in migratory behaviours. To answer these questions, we reconstructed their biogeographic histories and analysed their diversification patterns in terms of time, space and traits using a near‐complete phylogeny. We found the most recent common ancestor of Emberizidae and their sisters distributed in the New World. After invasion into the eastern Palearctic through the Bering Straits Bridge in the middle Miocene, subsequent loss of migrations probably split Emberizidae into two lineages: one radiated in Afrotropical deserts and savannah and the other mainly diversified in Palearctic semi‐open to open forests, the mountains of Central Asia and the Qinghai‐Tibetan Plateau. This group began to diversify in the late Miocene ({\textasciitilde}10 Ma), at first rapidly, coinciding with the expansion of open habitats due to global cooling. As the available habitats were occupied, the diversification rate of buntings decreased rapidly in arid habitats, but shifts of habitat preference to open forests led to terminal radiations on the southern edge of taiga forests in the mountains of Central Asia and the eastern Palearctic. Our results provide insight into the biogeographic histories and radiation of the Old World buntings in open habitats.},

            We reconstruct the species-level phylogenetic relationship among toucans, toucan-barbets, New World barbets using phylogenomic data to assess the monophyly and relationships at the family, generic, and specific levels. Our analyses confirmed (1) the monophyly of toucans (Aves: Ramphastidae), toucan-barbets (Aves: Semnornithidae), and New World barbets (Aves: Capitonidae) and that the toucan-barbets are sister to the toucans, an arrangement suggested, but poorly supported, in previously published phylogenies; (2) the paraphyly of lowland Selenidera toucanets with respect to Andigena mountain-toucans; and (3) evidence of some mitonuclear discordance, suggesting introgression or incomplete lineage sorting. For example, mitonuclear conflict in the phylogenetic placement of Ramphastos vitellinus subspecies suggests that Amazonian populations of Ramphastos vitellinus ariel may have introgressed mitogenomes derived from other Amazonian vitellinus taxa. To reconstruct the phylogenetic history of toucans, toucan-barbets, and New World barbets, we included all species-level taxa from the three families, with the addition of outgroups from the two major clades of Old World barbets (Megalaimidae and Lybiidae). We analyzed a combination of UCE sequences and whole mitochondrial genome sequences to reconstruct phylogenetic trees.},

In order to determine whether any additional, unexpectedly deep lineages occur in African endemic songbirds, 29 species—including 10 enigmatic focal taxa endemic to southern Africa—were added to a large nuclear sequence dataset gathered from oscine songbirds (Passeri). Phylogenetic analyses of these data resolve many long-standing questions about the affinities of these birds, not all of which were predicted by traditional approaches. The application of a molecular clock indicates that most basal divergences in Passerida occurred in the middle to late Eocene, with divergences between African and Australasian core corvoids occurring somewhat later in the early Miocene. Consistent with inferences for mammals, divergences between Malagasy endemic passerines and their mainland relatives suggests an asynchronous colonization history. This emerging phylogenetic picture reveals that relationships within Old World families are highly informative regarding the early dispersal and radiation of songbirds out of Gondwana. Future analyses will depend on improving resolution of higher-level phylogenetic relationships among these groups, and increasing the density of taxon sampling within them.},

	abstract = {Wallace's Line demarcates the transition between the differentiated regional faunas of Asia and Australia. However, while patterns of biotic differentiation across these two continental landmasses and the intervening island groups (Wallacea) have been extensively studied, patterns of long-term dispersal and diversification across this region are less well understood. Frogmouths (Aves: Podargidae) are a relictual family of large nocturnal birds represented by three extant genera occurring, respectively, in Asia, ‘Sahul’ (Australia and New Guinea) and the Solomon Islands, thus spanning Wallace's Line. We used new mitochondrial genomes from each of the extant frogmouth genera to estimate the timeline of frogmouth evolution and dispersal across Wallace's Line. Our results suggest that the three genera diverged and dispersed during the mid-Cenozoic between approximately 30 and 40 Mya. These divergences are among the oldest inferred for any trans-Wallacean vertebrate lineage. In addition, our results reveal that the monotypic Solomons frogmouth ( 
              Rigidipenna inexpectata 
              ) is one of the most phylogenetically divergent endemic bird lineages in the southwest Pacific. We suggest that the contemporary distribution of exceptionally deep divergences among extant frogmouth lineages may be explained by colonization of, and subsequent long-term persistence on, island arcs in the southwest Pacific during the Oligocene. These island arcs may have provided a pathway for biotic dispersal out of both Asia and Australia that preceded the formation of extensive emergent landmasses in Wallacea by at least 10 million years.},

              Aim 
              We examined divergence times and biogeography of the avian order Galliformes (which, despite a nearly world‐wide distribution, includes many weak fliers), to test whether current distributions reflect vicariance or long‐distance dispersal. We also tested the impact of taxon sampling and tree topology on our estimates of historical biogeography. 
             
             
              Location 
              World‐wide. 
             
             
              Methods 
              We generated timetrees for all major galliform lineages using several fossil calibrations and a combination of mitochondrial and nuclear data. We compared divergence times and reconstructed ancestral ranges using this timetree and the galliforms from a recent synthetic tree for all birds. Thus, we explored the sensitivity of our conclusions to differences in topology and taxon sampling. 
             
             
              Results 
              The results suggest late Cretaceous origins for Megapodiidae and possibly for Cracidae, the earliest diverging families. The other families diversified in the Eocene after the break‐up of Gondwana, contrary to previous suggestions. Both topology and taxon sampling affected the ancestral area estimates, although many nodes were consistent among the approaches. 
             
             
              Main conclusions 
              Divergences of Numididae, Odontophoridae and Phasianidae occurred in Africa, with subsequent dispersal to other continents. Reconstructed ranges for ancestors of the earliest diverging families, Megapodiidae and Cracidae, are less conclusive, but may have involved a South American origin, then dispersal to other continents. Thus, long‐distance dispersal is likely to have been important in galliforms, possibly reflecting more vagile ancestors and repeated range expansions and contractions. There appears to be a trade‐off between the use of trees with rich taxon sampling but limited data, where key taxa can be misplaced, and more robust trees with missing taxa. When biogeographically important taxa are included, complete taxon sampling does not appear necessary for accurate ancestral area reconstruction. Robust trees that include taxa targeted based on their distribution may be the best way to improve our understanding of historical biogeography.},

            Songbirds (oscine passerines) are the most species-rich and cosmopolitan bird group, comprising almost half of global avian diversity. Songbirds originated in Australia, but the evolutionary trajectory from a single species in an isolated continent to worldwide proliferation is poorly understood. Here, we combine the first comprehensive genome-scale DNA sequence data set for songbirds, fossil-based time calibrations, and geologically informed biogeographic reconstructions to provide a well-supported evolutionary hypothesis for the group. We show that songbird diversification began in the Oligocene, but accelerated in the early Miocene, at approximately half the age of most previous estimates. This burst of diversification occurred coincident with extensive island formation in Wallacea, which provided the first dispersal corridor out of Australia, and resulted in independent waves of songbird expansion through Asia to the rest of the globe. Our results reconcile songbird evolution with Earth history and link a major radiation of terrestrial biodiversity to early diversification within an isolated Australian continent.},

Phylogenetic analyses converged into a congruent topology and defined several well‐supported clades. We calibrated a molecular clock and reconstructed ancestral biogeographical areas using Bayesian inference supporting an austral continental (Gondwanaland) origin of the waterfowls. Ducks, swans and geese might have diversified during the Miocene (23–5 Myr ago) reaching northern distributions in Holarctic and Afrotropical regions. The evolution of hybridization patterns in Anseriformes has been investigated using a cladistic analysis (morphology), which may underestimate or overestimate the phylogenetic divergence among species, or restricted only to ducks. Using a phylogenetic framework, genetic‐based distances and a Bayesian time calibration, our data support the hypothesis based on immunological distances of slow rate of appearance of reproductive incompatibilities in waterfowls compared with other vertebrates and the view that these birds may be like frogs in having lost their interspecific hybridization potential more slowly than mammals.},

We conducted a comprehensive sensitivity analysis to account for the heterogeneity across different DNA classes, leading to an optimal tree of Neoaves with high resolution. This phylogeny features a novel Neoavian dichotomy comprising two monophyletic clades: a previously recognized Telluraves (land birds) and a newly circumscribed Aquaterraves (waterbirds and relatives). Molecular dating analyses with 20 fossil calibrations indicate that the diversification of modern birds began in the Late Cretaceous and underwent a constant and steady radiation across the KPg boundary, concurrent with the rise of angiosperms as well as other major Cenozoic animal groups including placental and multituberculate mammals. The KPg catastrophe had a limited impact on avian evolution compared to the Paleocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum, which triggered a rapid diversification of seabirds. Our findings suggest that the evolution of modern birds followed a slow process of gradualism rather than a rapid process of punctuated equilibrium, with limited interruption by the KPg catastrophe. This study places bird evolution into a new context within vertebrates, with ramifications for the evolution of the Earth’s biota.},

However, several polytomous relationships remained within the clade, obstructing detailed biogeographical interpretations. This study presents a well-resolved family-level phylogeny, based on a dataset of 22 nuclear loci and using a suite of partitioning schemes and Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian inference methods. Resolving the relationships within the core Corvoidea provides evidence for three well-supported main clades, which are in turn sister to the New Zealand genus Mohoua. Some monotypic lineages, which have previously been considered Incertae sedis, are also placed in a phylogenetic context. The well-resolved phylogeny provides a robust framework for biogeographical analyses, and provides further support for the hypothesis that core corvoids originated in the proto-Papuan island region that emerged north of Australia in the late Oligocene/early Miocene. Thus, the core Corvoidea appear to represent a true island radiation, which successfully colonized all continents except Antarctica.},

A further problem is that their authors reach startlingly different conclusions regarding the numbers of taxa which should be recognised as species; 13 vs. 24. Here, we attempt to resolve this situation by supplying full length mitochondrial cytochrome b data presently missing for 2 taxa, carrying out thorough phylogenetic analyses meeting the requirements of published prescriptions and taking into full account other sources of new molecular data and contemporary opinions on albatross nomenclature and the status of taxa. We provide general support for the published trees and critically evaluate claims regarding how many taxa represent full species. Some genetic distances between pairs of taxa are so small that considerable weight of alternative evidence is required to support any decision leading to a recommendation to split them. We note that the empirical boundary between consensus and controversy falls at or around 1\% DNA sequence divergence and further that few, if any, commentators recognise taxa that are separated by less than 0.1\% as being valid species.},

	abstract = {The golden-mangrove whistler complex Pachycephala pectoralis/melanura is, with 66 named populations, described as the most complex avian example of geographic variation in the World. It represents a well-known example of niche differentiation where one species P. pectoralis is found on faunistically rich larger islands (and mainland) and the other P. melanura is confined to adjacent, faunistically poor islets. Except for a comparison of some Solomon Island populations, the relationships among these taxa have not been tested using molecular data. Here we combine a dense taxon sampling (22 populations of 12 named taxa distributed east of New Guinea and in Australia), with molecular data (two nuclear and two mitochondrial markers) to unravel more of the evolutionary history behind the golden whistler complex. In particular we examine relationships between Pachycephala melanura, and the very similar-looking P. citreogaster (Bismarcks Islands) and P. pectoralis (Australia). We demonstrate that a well-supported group of golden whistlers inhabit the Bismarck Islands and that several small islets in the immediate vicinity are inhabited by another monophyletic group consisting of P. melanura, mangrove golden whistler.},

We collected 1920-bp of nucleotide sequence data from the mitochondrial genes cytochrome b, ATPase 6, ATPase 8, and 591-bp of the single-copy nuclear gene c-mos for all Todus species and representatives of their outgroup taxa (Hylomanes, Barypthengus, Chloroceryle, Ceryle, and Galbula) to reconstruct the evolutionary history (via parsimony and maximum likelihood) of the five Todus species. The substitution rates among the mitochondrial genes were found to be much higher than the substitution rate for the c-mos gene, consequently resulting in higher substitutional saturation for the mitochondrial genes. When we applied weighting schemes to account for the variance in substitutional heterogeneity among the genes then parsimony and likelihood analyses both demonstrate that the genus Todus is monophyletic and closer to the Hylomanes and Barypthengus genera than the Chloroceryle and Ceryle genera. The mitochondrial-gene trees and nuclear-gene trees both show similar results, thus providing support for the relationships among the taxa from loci within two independently evolving genomes. The nuclear gene c-mos was found, therefore, to be a viable nuclear gene candidate for resolving intermediate and deep divergences.},

	abstract = {Crossbills (Aves: Loxia) and several conifers have coevolved in predator–prey arms races over the last 10,000 years. However, the extent to which coevolutionary arms races have contributed to the adaptive radiation of crossbills or to any other adaptive radiation is largely unknown. Here we extend our previous studies of geographically structured coevolution by considering a crossbill–conifer interaction that has persisted for a much longer time period and involves a conifer with more variable annual seed production. We examined geographic variation in the cone and seed traits of two sister species of pines, Pinus occidentalis and P. cubensis, on the islands of Hispaniola and Cuba, respectively. We also compared the Hispaniolan crossbill (Loxia megaplaga) to its sister taxa the North American white-winged crossbill (Loxia leucoptera leucoptera). The Hispaniolan crossbill is endemic to Hispaniola whereas Cuba lacks crossbills. In addition and in contrast to previous studies, the variation in selection experienced by these pines due to crossbills is not confounded by the occurrence of selection by tree squirrels (Tamiasciurus and Sciurus). As predicted if P. occidentalis has evolved defenses in response to selection exerted by crossbills, cones of P. occidentalis have scales that are 53\% thicker than those of P. cubensis. Cones of P. occidentalis, but not P. cubensis, also have well-developed spines, a known defense against vertebrate seed predators. Consistent with patterns of divergence seen in crossbills coevolving locally with other conifers, the Hispaniolan crossbill has evolved a bill that is 25\% deeper than the white-winged crossbill. Together with phylogenetic analyses, our results suggest that predator–prey coevolution between Hispaniolan crossbills and P. occidentalis over approximately 600,000 years has caused substantial morphological evolution in both the crossbill and pine. This also indicates that cone crop fluctuations do not prevent crossbills and conifers from coevolving. Furthermore, because the traits at the phenotypic interface of the interaction apparently remain the same over at least several hundred thousand years, divergence as a result of coevolution is greater at lower latitude where crossbill–conifer interactions have been less interrupted by Pleistocene events.},

	abstract = {Birds of paradise (Aves: Paradisaeidae) exhibit extreme differences among taxa in courtship-related form (i.e. courtship phenotype). In the genus Parotia, the courtship phenotype is organizationally modular and this property may play an important role in the evolution of phenotypic disparity among taxa. The present study investigates variational aspects of phenotypic modularity in the Parotia by examining the structure and composition of courtship form in a comparative context. First, a module-based model of male display-phenotypes is compiled for four biological species to facilitate phenotypic comparison. Models are constructed using data from existing phenotype ontologies and associated video-vouchers. Next, a phylogenetic analysis of display-phenotype data is performed using a matrix of 47 etho-phenotypic characters coded for eight Parotia and out-group taxa. Analysis yields one tree, length 60 (CI = 0.83; RI = 0.85). The results demonstrate variation among taxa to be greater at higher-levels of phenotypic integration (i.e. among display-modules) than at intermediate and lower-levels (i.e. among phase- and element-modules). Three display-modules and five of six phase-modules were present in the common ancestor and complexity has increased through time as the display-modules became dissociated into subunits that diverged independently. The history of Parotia evolution involves numerous instances of duplication and divergence of etho-phenotypic modular components and likely reflects the same processes that have contributed to the pronounced phenotypic disparity within the entire bird of paradise radiation.},

The family Hirundinidae was confirmed to consist of two clades, Pseudochelidoninae (river martins) and Hirundininae (typical swallows). The Hirundininae is further divided into mud nesters (Hirundo sensu lato), core martins (Phedina, Riparia, and New World endemic genera), and basal relicts (Psalidoprocne, Cheramoeca, and Pseudhirundo). We did not resolve the hierarchy among these three hirundinine groups, but discovered many relationships within them. Mud-nesting genera have the following relationships: (Hirundo sensu stricto, Ptyonoprogne), (Delichon, (Petrochelidon, Cecropis)). Core martins have the following topology: (Phedina, Riparia cincta), (Riparia sensu stricto, Tachycineta, ((Stelgidopteryx, Progne), (Neotropical endemic genera))). Interspecific relationships among the Neotropical endemics were resolved completely; Atticora and Notiochelidon are paraphyletic, and all Neotropical endemics probably should be lumped into one or two genera. The final group of hirundinines, the basal relicts, consists of a sister pair, the Australian Cheramoeca and African Pseudhirundo. The African saw-wings (Psalidoprocne) are their likely sister group.},

	abstract = {Despite its status as a global biodiversity hotspot there is still much to be discovered about the birds of Madagascar, including a full accounting of species-level diversity and the avifauna's origins. The Bernieridae is a Malagasy endemic family that went unrecognized by science for decades and unnamed until 2010. This cryptic family has long represented a missing piece of the puzzle of the avian tree of life. We present the first comprehensive phylogeny of Bernieridae in order to examine its diversification history on Madagascar and its place within Passeriformes. In light of recent discoveries of cryptic species-level diversity in Madagascar's vertebrate fauna, we used broad geographic sampling and integrative taxonomic methods to investigate the potential for cryptic lineages within every known species of the Bernieridae. Our approach combines phylogenomics using approximately 4500 loci of ultraconserved elements (UCEs), genetic clustering of thousands of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), and statistical analysis of morphological variation. These methods yielded the discovery of two unrecognized species in the previously monotypic genus Bernieria, along with new insights into patterns of fine-scale endemism in Madagascar's humid forests. Our phylogenomic analyses provide conclusive support for Donacobiidae and Bernieridae as sister families, a biogeographically intriguing result given that the former is restricted to the Neotropics. We found a significant decline in the rate of speciation over time on Madagascar, consistent with a model of adaptive radiation. Bernieridae therefore joins the Vangidae as a second avian adaptive radiation on the island of Madagascar. These insights into the evolution of Bernieridae represent a step forward in understanding the origins and diversity of Madagascar's endemic avifauna.},

	abstract = {We examined patterns of variation in skeletal morphometrics (29 characters), allozymes (34 loci), mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) restriction sites (n = 74) and fragments (n = 395), and mtDNA sequences (1,739 bp from cytochrome b, ND2, ND6, and the control region) among all species of Toxostoma. The phenetic pattern of variation in skeletal morphometrics generally matched traditional taxonomic groupings (based on plumage patterns) with the exceptions of T. redivivum, which because of its large size clusters outside of its proper evolutionary group (lecontei), and T. occelatum, which did not cluster with T. curvirostre. Skull characters contributed highly to species discrimination, suggesting that unique feeding adaptations arose in different species groups. Although genetic variation was detected at isozyme loci (average heterozygosity = 3.6\%), these data yielded little phylogenetic resolution. Similarly, mtDNA restriction sites were relatively uninformative; hence, phylogenetic conclusions were based on sequence data. Phylogenetic analyses confirmed the monophyly of these traditionally recognized assemblages: rufum group (T. rufum, T. longirostre, and T. guttatum), lecontei group (T. lecontei, T. crissale, and T. redivivum), and cinereum group (T. bendirei and T. cinereum). The cinereum and lecontei groups appear to be sister lineages. Monophyly of the curvirostre group (which also includes T. occelatum) was not confirmed. Sequence data suggest that T. occelatum and T. curvirostre, which differ by 7.7\% sequence divergence, are probably most closely related to the rufum group. Toxostoma rufum and T. longirostre have similar external appearances and differ by 5.0\%. Toxostoma guttatum is restricted to Cozumel Island and often is considered a subspecies of T. longirostre; it differs by more than 5\% from the other two members of the rufum group and is a distinct species constituting the basal member of this group. The phenotypically distinctive T. bendirei and T. cinereum differ in sequence divergence by only 1.6\%. Overall, mtDNA distances computed from coding genes (mean 8.5\%) exceeded distances computed from the control region (mean 7.6\%), contrary to expectation. Because neither allozymes nor mtDNA could unambiguously resolve the placement of T. occelatum and T. curvirostre, a scenario involving contemporaneous speciation is suggested. Application of a molecular clock suggested that most speciation occurred in the late Pliocene or early Pleistocene.},

We here test species limits in the avian Lesser Short-toed Lark Alaudala rufesens–Sand Lark A. raytal complex, which has an intricate taxonomic history, ranging from a single to three recognised species, with different inclusiveness in different treatments. Our integrative taxonomic approach is based on a combination of DNA sequences, plumage, biometrics, songs, song-flights, geographical distributions, habitat, and bioclimatic data, and using various methods including a species delimitation program (STACEY) based on the multispecies coalescent model. We propose that four species should be recognised: Lesser Short-toed Lark A. rufescens (sensu stricto), Heine’s Short-toed Lark A. heinei, Asian Short-toed Lark A. cheleensis and Sand Lark A. raytal. There is also some evidence suggesting lineage separation within A. cheleensis and A. raytal, but additional data are required to evaluate this. The species delimitation based on STACEY agrees well with the non-genetic data. Although computer-based species delimitation programs can be useful in identifying independently evolving lineages, we stress that whenever possible, species hypotheses proposed by these programs should be tested by independent, non-genetic data. Our results highlight the difficulty and subjectivity of delimiting lineages and species, especially at early stages in the speciation process.},

	abstract = {Spoonbills (genus Platalea) are a small group of wading birds, generally considered to constitute the subfamily Plataleinae (Aves: Threskiornithidae). We reconstructed phylogenetic relationships among the six species of spoonbills using variation in sequences of the mitochondrial genes ND2 and cytochrome b (total 1796 bp). Topologies of phylogenetic trees reconstructed using maximum likelihood, maximum parsimony, and Bayesian analyses were virtually identical and supported monophyly of the spoonbills. Most relationships within Platalea received strong support: P. minor and P. regia were closely related sister species, P. leucorodia was sister to the minor-regia clade, and P. alba was sister to the minor-regia-leucorodia clade. Relationships of P. flavipes and P. ajaja were less well resolved: these species either formed a clade that was sister to the four-species clade, or were successive sisters to this clade. This phylogeny is consistent with ideas of relatedness derived from spoonbill morphology. Our limited sampling of the Threskiornithinae (ibises), the putative sister group to the spoonbills, indicated that this group is paraphyletic, in agreement with previous molecular data; this suggests that separation of the Threskiornithidae into subfamilies Plataleinae and Threskiornithinae may not be warranted.},
